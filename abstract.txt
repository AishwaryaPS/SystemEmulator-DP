-> Project Title : Emulating a Computer System/CPU 

-> Abstract : 
    programming language  :  c++

    Idea of the project is to develop interfaces for the different components of a computer system in the low level 
    And define implementations to define their behavior and how they interact with each other.
    
    The different components under consideration are : 
        - Client component
        - CPU component 
        - Input-Output Devices 
        - I/O buffer components
        - DMA component
        - CPU Scheduling component 
        - Cache component      
        - Memory component     
        - BUS and PORTS
    
    The Design Patterns that can be implemented for such a system includes : 
        Creational DP  {
                            - Singleton // for all those cpu,dma ,etc where one instance is needed
                            - factory method  // buffer class - > giving both output buffer and input buffer
                                              // cache class  - > giving l1,l2,l3 cache
                            - prototype // cloning mem classes for threads of same process  
                       }
        
        Structural DP {
                            - Adapters // needed btw diff components for communication
                      }        

        Behavioral DP {
                            - template // dma and I/O queue can be modeled under one template 
                                       // or even BUS and PORTS
                                       // cache and main mem
                            - strategy // for cpu scheduling algos 
                            - iterator // within mem components to fetch next block 
                      }
